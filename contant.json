The game also has a day and night cycle along with rules you need to follow in the town, public transport and a bunch of easter eggs. One of the issues which most players have with the game is the fact that things like clothes are really overpriced and you really need to grind to obtain them. Considering the game is free it does somewhat justify the high costs but it would be better if items werenâ€™t so hard to get.",

The sound effects do get a little annoying sometimes but the in-game music is not too bad. Overall the graphics and audio wonâ€™t give you too many issues.The controls are pretty easy to get used to. You can move around, look around and jump. The camera angle is above the shoulder and the UI is also pretty easy to understand. Once you get the hang of the options and the interface, the game would get quite easy. At the start, things can be a bit confusing but youâ€™ll get used to it.",
